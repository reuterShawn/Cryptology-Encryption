We used Kasiski examination to deterimine key lengths. This was implemented using tools available in most word prossessing software. 
We identified repeats in the text by looking closely at the text and control f. Length between repeats was determined using word count. 
Once we determined several of these lengths, we determined the key length by looking at common divisors of these.
